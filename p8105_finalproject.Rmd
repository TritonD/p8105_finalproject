**The group members (names and UNIs)**
Xingyuan Chen (xc2473);  Xin He (xh2395); Yunzhi Qian (yq2251); Stephanie Zhen (sz2800); Katie Gao (kxg2002)

**The tentative project title**
H1-B Visa Application Characteristics in America

**The motivation for this project**
     As immigration policies are changing in the US. Many international students are concerned about their eligibility to work in the states. As international students and friends of international students who are able to graduate, we are interested in how H1B visa applications will affect/dictate our job-seeking opportunities. We have multiple group members who are personally interested in this topic.
