**The tentative project title** H1-B Visa Application Characteristics in
America

**The motivation for this project** As immigration policies are changing
in the US. Many international students are concerned about their
eligibility to work in the states. As international students and friends
of international students who are able to graduate, we are interested in
how H1B visa applications will affect/dictate our job-seeking
opportunities. We have multiple group members who are personally
interested in this topic.

**The intended final products** Comparisons of the number of Visa
applicants by states, years, industries (SOC code/SOC name) and
nationalities Wage distribution of Visa applicants The average length
for process period for the Visa application
